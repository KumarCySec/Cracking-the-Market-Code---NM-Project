# 📊 Cracking the Market Code with AI-Driven Stock Price Prediction

Welcome to the **Stock Price Prediction** project! This project aims to leverage advanced AI models, including **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** and **XGBoost**, for accurate stock price prediction using time series analysis.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is focused on building an AI-driven model to predict stock prices with high accuracy. Using a dataset of Wipro stock prices, we perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and build sophisticated models to make predictions.

## 📌 Key Features

* Advanced Time-Series Analysis
* Models: **LSTM (Deep Learning)** and **XGBoost (Gradient Boosting)**
* Feature Engineering with Time-Lagged Variables
* Advanced Data Visualization
* Performance Evaluation (RMSE, R² Score)
